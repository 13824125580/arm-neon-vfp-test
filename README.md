arm-neon-vfp-test
=================

Simple test code to benchmark the VFP floating point or NEON units of
ARM processors.

I found some code online when researching how to compile code to take
advantage of the NEON units that some ARM processors have built-in.  The
code was in a thread on the BeagleBoard discussion board here:

I am just republishing it here on github to make it easier for other
folks to find and work with.
